Answer the following question about ships step by step.
Identify and restate the key facts given (ship names, positions, times,
speeds, and headings).
Translate these into a structured representation (e.g., positions on a
timeline, coordinates, vectors).
Calculate intermediate values: relative velocities,
projected positions at the specified times, distances, and bearings.
Reason explicitly about the relations between ships (e.g., who is ahead, who
is closer, when/where they intersect).
State any assumptions (straight-line motion, constant speed, unit conversions).
Provide the final answer, clearly summarizing the relationship.
Do not skip steps; show the full chain of reasoning before the conclusion.
Show all steps and then give a succinct answer.
